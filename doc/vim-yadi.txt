Yet Another Detect Indent. Here is how it works in my `.vimrc`:

    " Try to auto detect and use the indentation of a file when opened. 
>
    autocmd BufRead * DetectIndent
<
    " Otherwise use file type specific indentation. E.g. tabs for Makefiles
    " and 4 spaces for Python. This is optional.
>
    filetype plugin indent on
<
    " Set a fallback here in case detection fails and there is no file type
    " plugin available. You can also omit this, then Vim defaults to tabs.
>
    set expandtab shiftwidth=4 softtabstop=4
<
    " You stay in control of your tabstop setting.
>
    set tabstop=4
<

The plugin is built on the following principles:

*   Ignore outliers. A few bad whitespace should not stop the plugin from
    working. But as a user I don't want to be warned of or worse required to fix
    those inconsistencies. That's not in the scope of this plugin.
*   Leave settings unchanged if detection fails. The users `.vimrc` or
    file type plugins (https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/File_type_plugins)
    should then determine the indentation style.
*   Only ever touch the
    3 settings relevant to indentation (https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Indenting_source_code#Setup):
    `expandtab`, `shiftwidth` and `softtabstop`
*   Be a single, short and easy to comprehend Vimscript file.

Take a look at the code (https://github.com/timakro/vim-yadi/blob/main/plugin/yadi.vim#L17-L62),
it fits on a single page.

COMMANDS                                                       *yadi-commands*

The `:DetectIndent` command tries to auto detect the indentation style in the
current buffer.
If it finds tabs it sets `noexpandtab shiftwidth=0 softtabstop=0`,
if it finds n spaces it sets  `expandtab shiftwidth=n softtabstop=n`.
If the algorithm can't confidently determine the indentation style no settings
are changed. It comes naturally to set this as an autocommand as can be seen
above.

The `:IndentTabs` and `:IndentSpaces <n>` commands explicitly apply the
settings for tabs and spaces respectively. The argument to `:IndentSpaces` can
be omitted in which case your tabstop setting will be used.

THE ALGORITHM                                             *yadi-the_algorithm*

The developers of the Firefox dev tools wrote
a great article (https://medium.com/firefox-developer-tools/detecting-code-indentation-eff3ed0fb56b)
where they compare different indentation detection strategies for Firefox's
built-in source editor. yadi.vim uses the "comparing lines" strategy from the
article because it performs well and is easy to implement. The article explains
it well:
>
    This method compares the indentation of each line with the previous line, and
    adds the difference to a tally. So if a line is indented by 10 spaces, and
    the previous by 8, one more vote would be added for 2-space indentation.
<

Mixed tabs and spaces as well as 1-space indentation are not supported. This is
a deliberate choice as these indentation styles are rare and would complicate
the algorithm considerably.

Furthermore there is a heuristic in place to prevent misdetection. More than
80% of the file must be either tabs or spaces for the detection to succeed.
Additionally in the case of spaces the most common indentation level must make
up more than 60% of all indentations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION WITH STATUSLINES               *yadi-integration_with_statuslines*

To display the current indentation settings in your statusline you could use
this expression:
>
    let &statusline = '%{&expandtab?shiftwidth()." sp":"tabs"}'
<

Or with lightline.vim (https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim):
>
    let g:lightline = {
          \ 'active': {
          \   'right': [ [ 'lineinfo' ],
          \              [ 'percent' ],
          \              [ 'fileformat', 'fileencoding', 'filetype', 'indentstyle' ] ]
          \ },
          \ 'component': {
          \   'indentstyle': '%{&expandtab?shiftwidth()." sp":"tabs"}'
          \ },
          \ }
<

WHY YET ANOTHER CLONE OF DETECTINDENT? *yadi-why_yet_another_clone_of_detectindent?*

There are a bunch of plugins with DetectIndent-like functionality:

*   DetectIndent (https://github.com/ciaranm/detectindent)
*   sleuth.vim (https://github.com/tpope/vim-sleuth)
*   Yaifa (https://github.com/Raimondi/yaifa)
*   matchindent.vim (https://github.com/conormcd/matchindent.vim)
*   IndentFinder (https://github.com/ldx/vim-indentfinder)

But none of them let you fall back to file type plugins if detection fails.
Most of them force you to set a fallback indentation style. sleuth.vim
(https://github.com/tpope/vim-sleuth) is more sophisticated and tries to
guess the indentation from surrounding files. It's a different approach
which comes at the cost of greater complexity and makes the result rather
unpredictable.
